A [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)) clone made with python and pygame 

From wikipedia:
>Breakout begins with eight rows of bricks, with each two rows a different color. The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to ricochet the ball against the bricks and eliminate them.
